# RZD ticket checking Telegram bot

### Description

This is a simple project for personal use.
It monitors presence of available train tickets in certain train at certain dates.

The Telegram bot will alarm with a message if an available ticket shows up.

### Install and launch

First, install `docker`.

Then run `sh launch.sh`

### P.S.

The same day this bot was launched it has found a sitting type ticket at evening.
And I bought it as soon as possible.
So I guess writing this bot wasn't worthless.
