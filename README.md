# RZD tickets checking Telegram bot

### Description

This is a simple project for personal use. It just monitoring presence
of economy-class seats in certain train at certain dates.

The Telegram bot will alarm with a message if a ticket will show up.

### Install and launch

First, install `docker`.

Then run `sh launch.sh`

### P.S.

On the same day this bot has been launched it found a sitting type ticket at evening.
And I bought it as soon as possible.
So I guess this writing this bot wasn't worthless.
